Performance of the 7 alternative strategies with respect to the "Minimise number of severe cases" and "Minimise number of people in need of intensive care"  attributes are very close, specifically under Scenario 2,3, 5. Notably, utilities of the Strategies 0-5 for "# of severe cases"" and "# ICU" are about the same under Scenario 3 -- due to similar shapes and disticnt points of the respective value functions (mind the bisection method).






## Modified value function for mortalities
Value function of mortality seems to be impractical as its zero value corresponds to 50 000 cases. "50 000 mortalities" assumes Scenario 5 (the most lethal) and Strategy 0 (do nothing), which sets the lowest possible "bar" for performance. Another connected issue is that the value function is linear, meaning that low number of deaths relative to 50 000 (e.g. 16 under scenario 2) gives a minuscule penalty to the utility as it evaluate performance proportionally (1- 16/50 000).

The shape of a value function could be dependant on a scenario. Indeed, with a mild scenario we should not expect more than 100 mortalities whereas with a catastrophic scenario 5 more than 10 000 is a real possibility. However, at the time of decision regariding the intervention strategy it is uknown which scenario is to unfold. Therefore, the shape of the "Mortalities value function"" could be modified to reflect "worst-cases" for each scenario (as estimated by the simulation model).
